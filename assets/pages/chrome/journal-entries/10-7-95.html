                Welp an average day what am I supposed to say to these things now I can’t remember but this new journal issue by the oh-fives it’s kind of stupid to be honest but guess it’s what I have to do. 

                I guess today I walked around the side a lot kind of a slow day at the office. I’ve big happen no stupid breaches or any of that stuff you know, but I met with Rose. We chatted for a few hours. 
                
                I went to SCP 076 cell and I did a little inspection and make sure wasn’t gonna escape or anything can’t have able murdering all our staff so that was fun. Took a little field trip.
                
                I had dinner at the canteen like usual nothing special to be honest but with baked beans and turkey sliders so that was pretty good for what the usual food is so I’m not complaining and guess I’ll check in tomorrow!
